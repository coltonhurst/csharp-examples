# csharp-examples

Different concepts and examples in the [C# programming language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/). All examples target [net5.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/frameworks) or higher, so they are cross platform via .NET Core.

## Examples

- [Object Serialization with XML](./serialization-xml/Program.cs)
- [Tuples](./tuples/Program.cs)
- Threads
  - [Basic Threading](./threads-basic/Program.cs)
  - [Join & Sleep](./threads-join-sleep/Program.cs)
- Tasks
  - [Basic Tasks](./tasks-basic/Program.cs)
- [Overflow](./overflow/Program.cs)

## Building

To build and run an example, just `cd` into the example you want, and run `dotnet run`. You should have the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) installed.

## Thanks

A lot of the examples have been based on example code and explanations from the [C# in a Nutshell](http://www.albahari.com/nutshell/) series (like the [basic threading example](./threads-basic/Program.cs)). Thanks to the authors for great explanations and code examples.
