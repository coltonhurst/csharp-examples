# csharp-examples

Different concepts and examples in the [C# programming language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/). All examples target [net5.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/frameworks) or higher, so they are cross platform via .NET Core.

## Examples

- [Object Serialization with XML](./serialization-xml/Program.cs)
- [Tuples](./tuples/Program.cs)

## Building

To build and run an example, just `cd` into the example you want, and run `dotnet run`. You should have the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) installed.

## Thanks

Some of the examples have been based on example code and explanations from [C# 7.0 in a Nutshell](https://web.archive.org/web/20201111233013/https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/c-70-in/9781491987643/) (like the [basic threading example](./threads-basic/Program.cs)). Thanks to the authors for great explanations and code examples.
